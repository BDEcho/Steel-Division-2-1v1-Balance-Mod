# Steel-Division-2-1v1-Balance-Mod


This iteration builds on a few of the aspects of  the 1vs1 balance mod by MRcrisp and I Gensei.  I will act on player feedback and suggestions for further changes. I hope to bring some changes that could be playtested by the community and hopefully for you the most liked will make their way into the game somehow even though I donâ€™t have any hopes... The major changes are displayed here.
